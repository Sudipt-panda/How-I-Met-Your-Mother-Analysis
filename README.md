 Projects   Project nameA Visual Narrative of Ramayana using Extractive Summarisation, Topic Modeling and NER tagging Oct 2019 – Mar 2020 Project descriptionIn this project, Aim is to create a visual narrative of one of the major epics of Indian Literature-'Ramayana', by summarizing the major topics and linking them with the characters and locations using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Using this research, any person interested in studying these manuscripts can visualize the tenor of the entire script, without an intensive study. 'Ramayana' was originally written in Sanskrit, but modern versions have Sanskrit text with the explanation in Hindi (as most people in India are well versed with Hindi). In this paper, we have divided the Hindi and Sanskrit text and considered only Hindi text for our further research. We have used existing scientific models (that are trained on the Hindi Language) to find events/topics, summaries, characters and locations that are later used to produce a visual narrative of the data. For the evaluation of our results, we have tried to review the understanding of our summaries and topics. We achieved this by providing a part of our input text and its summary as well as topics/events created by our data-pipeline, to 30 people (who are well versed with the Hindi Language).
